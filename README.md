# snakegame

This was created using Eclipse February/March of my freshman year for fun because fun is good
I took the AP computer science class for Java that year and while I didn't learn much because I didn't listen it probably inspired me to code. 
I searched up a bunch of stuff on how to do certain things in the Java coding language (eg key listeners and Jframes) and then coded this game referenced from the infamous google snake game.
It's all coded in a single class and much of the functions are coded in the constructor. Did not project what was taught in class very well.
Anyways, the nice thing is it's all in one file so if you wanted to you could just copy and paste over the code instead of downloading it.
First project put in github but I coded a few smaller projects before that one.

How do I add a picture of the game?? I don't know how to add a picture into this readme file :(
